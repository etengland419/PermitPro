## Feature Prioritization Framework

### Priority Levels

**P0 - Must Have (Blocker)**
- Required for core value proposition
- Blocks revenue or key user flows
- Legal/compliance requirement

**P1 - Should Have (High Priority)**
- Significant user value
- Competitive advantage
- Supports key metrics

**P2 - Nice to Have (Medium Priority)**
- Incremental improvements
- Delight features
- Efficiency gains

**P3 - Could Have (Low Priority)**
- Exploration/experimentation
- Long-term bets
- Edge cases

### Decision Criteria

Features are evaluated on:
1. **User Impact** (0-10): How many users benefit?
2. **Revenue Impact** (0-10): Does it drive MRR/ARR?
3. **Effort** (1-10): Engineering complexity (lower is better)
4. **Strategic Value** (0-10): Moat building, differentiation

**Score Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (User Impact + Revenue Impact + Strategic Value) / Effort
```

Scores >5.0 = P0
Scores 3.0-5.0 = P1
Scores 1.5-3.0 = P2
Scores <1.5 = P3
